    Using HTML, I created a form where employee infomation can be added and their salaries can be shown as monthly expenses. Using JavaScript, I used functions that added the employee's info to the table and converted the total employees' yearly salaries into monthly expenses. I also made it possible for the user to delete an employee's information and salary, and update the monthly expenses accordingly.
